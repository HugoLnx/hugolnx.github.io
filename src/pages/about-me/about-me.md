Hi, I'm Hugo.  
Thanks for being here! I hope you learn a little bit more about the person behind the code.

## What I love in game development
- Programming: I love to create new stuff with programming and even more to surpass technical challenges to bring something new to life.
- Games: I love playing them and their power to impact people and how they experience the world.
- Learning: I'm always trying to expand what I can create and how well I do it.
- Creativity: I'm excited about all areas that involve the creation of a game, that includes game design, art, and narrative. (Although I'm way better at coding)

## My favorite game genres
- Platformers like Celeste, The Messenger, Shovel Knight, Metroid, Castlevania, and Megaman Serie.
- Rhythm games like Guitar Hero, Beat Sabe, and Pump it Up.
- Couch games like Super Smash Bros, Towerfall Ascension, and Skullgirls 2nd Encore.

## Also, I love to...
- Hike
- Sing at the karaoke
- Make my own tea herbs mix
- Travel (Peru, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Argentina, and within Brazil as well)
